# quiz master game

{Provide a description of your team project.  Describe how to use the software.}
This is a quiz game that can test a students knowledge of Science, Math, Geography, Spelling, or Programming
To make it fun we planned to have each question come with a little bit of a story, with each question combining to make a fun narrative story. 
When the app starts up the Home Page is shown
It has two options "Continue" or "New Game"
If you select "New Game" you are presented with a menu where you can select one of the previously mentioned subjects. Selecting one of these starts the story corresponding to the subject and presents questions for that subject.
Back on the Home Page, if you select "Continue" you are taken to the next question for the story where you last left off.
